# Playwright, NUnit & DI

This example shows an example on how you could use Page Object Models with NUnit and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). Next to just the basics it shows how you could use IConfiguration, manage dependencies within your tests like the POMs, configuration and for instance Keyvault.

## Page Object Models
```//story about poms```

## Configuration
```//configuration```

## Dependency Injection
```//handle creation of poms and other objects```

## Azure Keyvault using Managed Identity
```//handling passwords and other secrets```

## HttpClient
```//Todo: Manage HttpClient and connect to an api (reuse token from browser session)```
